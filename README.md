# Sentiment_Analysis_
A comprehensive NLP project for sentiment and emotion classification using TF-IDF, lemmatization, and machine learning models including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. Includes data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation

#Project Purpose
This project aims to build a machine learning system that classifies text data based on sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and emotion (joy, anger, sadness, etc.). It leverages NLP and classification techniques to support real-world applications such as customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, recommendation systems, and mental health tracking.
